This project has existed in different iterations as new data came in. Files are
prefixed with this iteration, which are explained as follows:

* 01: Pilot data
* 02: Added first timecourse data
* 03: Added second timecourse data
* 04: Combined both timecourses and pilot
* 05: Knockout data
* 06: Combined all data

The notebooks are work product, intended to record decisions like parameter choices.
They are not intended as a fully reproducible data workflow and are tailored to the dataset.
They contain tangents and paths that are explored but not included in the manuscript.
